### Rules

So i've created master files for the data i want to test with.
Master csv files contain data from 01/02/2019 - 01/02/2023.

Currently working in the chale.ipynb file

Chale.ipynb is a jpty file for an LSTM built on MTNGH data
As of now, the model exists.

### Work To do

1. Finish LSTM by adding a streamlit interface
2. Use Fb prophet and test approach
