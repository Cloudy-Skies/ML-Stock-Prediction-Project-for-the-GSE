### Rules


### Data
i've created master files for the data i want to test with.
Master csv files contain data from 01/02/2008 - 01/02/2023.
A trading year typically has 252 days. 
Therefore there are approxiately 3,780 time-series values for each stock. There are 10 stocks currently so the totall time series values are approximately 38,000 values.

### LSTM

Chale.ipynb is a jpty file for an LSTM built on MTNGH data
As of now, the model exists.

### Work To do

1. Finish LSTM by adding a streamlit interface
2. Use Fb prophet and test approach

   )
3. Consider portfolio prediction as per Dr. Appati suggestions.

## Update: 28/03/2023
Streamlit interface for LSTM has been put on backburner

### Models to do for next 2 days
1. Prophet
2. Autoregressive (AR)
3. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

### Models to do by the end of saturday
4. Exponential Smoothing (ES)
5. XGBoost
6. DeepAR
7. N-BEATS
8. Temporal Fusion Transformer (Google)
